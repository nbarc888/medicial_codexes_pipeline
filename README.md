# medical-codex-pipeline

THIS ONE IS DEFUNCT PLEASE REFER TO PROPER REPO FOR OFFICIALIZED VERSION : 
https://github.com/nbarc888/medical_codex_pipeline.git

Version kept open for timelog of pushes and updates to files. 
This version is scrapped due to git push issue of accidental upload and deletion of file "SNOWMED_Smaller.csv" . 
Multiple fixes were attempted such as git --origin, etc. 
Only solution was to copy medical codex folder and reupload new folder as a seperate repository.
